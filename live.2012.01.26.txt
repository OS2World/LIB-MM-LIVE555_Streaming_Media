        Long Description: LIVE555 Streaming Media 2012.01.26
This code forms a set of C++ libraries for multimedia streaming, using open
standard protocols (RTP/RTCP, RTSP, SIP). These libraries - which can be
compiled for Unix (including Linux and Mac OS X), Windows, and QNX (and other
POSIX-compliant systems) - can be used to build streaming applications. The
libraries are already being used to implement applications such as "the
LIVE555 Media Server" (a RTSP server application), "liveCaster" and
"playRTPMPEG" (for streaming MP3 audio using RTP/RTCP), and "vobStreamer" (for
streaming DVD content using RTP/RTCP/RTSP). The libraries can also be used to
stream, receive, and process MPEG, H.264, H.263+, DV or JPEG video, and several
audio codecs. They can easily be extended to support additional (audio and/or
video) codecs, and can also be used to build basic RTSP or SIP clients and
servers, and have been used to add streaming support to existing media player
applications, such as "VLC" and "MPlayer".
